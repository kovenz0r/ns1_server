-----------------------------------


Well, this is it.  Nearly a year's worth of work on this level, and it's all come to this.  It's been a wild ride, but it's been worth it.

Thanks to the following:
-HanzGruber for the alienhive.mp3 soundfile that I've used in my hive rooms.
-The EC groupies who helped me playtest this, because without you, I wouldn't have had nearly as long of a hall as I do now.
-Relic, Merk, and Ken - You showed me how great a level can look, and I can only hope one day to be able to make mine look as good as yours.
-Flayra, Cory, and the rest of the NS dev team - You've given me the best game I've ever played and asked nothing in return.
-All you lamers out there - Without you, I'd never have had as much fun as I did this past year.  !b *!*@* ;Þ
-And lastly, I'd like to thank all the people who end up playing this map, and enjoying it.  If that's even one person out there, all this work will be worth it.
