------Thanks---------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to the NS Dev team for making this great mod that has kept me from doing as much homework as I should.

Thanks to the NS Playtester team for helping me with good feedback and taking time to disuss with me the changes and updates to help make the map that much better.

Thanks Plaguebearer for taking my mediocre layout and turning it into something awsome which was the layout for the first Altair in b5.

Thanks to TyrNemesis^ for helping me walk around the map and pointing out balance issues and node placement issues and generally helping to make Altair even better through 3.0.

Thanks to kmart and routerbox for helping me adjust the layout to be more condusive to competitive play.

Thanks to JazzX, Zephor, and Ken for being the top three playtesters when it comes to giving well thought out and detailed feedback.

Thanks to Olmy for really pushing me to improve Altair with several new ideas which lead me to rebuild several areas of the map to push Altair to be much greater visually and for building a new Life Support and Sub Bay (especially the new sub)
